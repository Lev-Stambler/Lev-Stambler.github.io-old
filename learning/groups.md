### Lecture 1
- A group is a set with a binary operation that satisfies:
  -  Having associativity
  - an identity element
  - each element has an element which inverts it and yields the identity

### Lecture 2
- An identity element is unique in a group
- Groups are not necessarily commutative. Commutative groups are called Abelian groups
- Isomorphism: two groups are isomorphic if you could rename the elements of the set and end up with the same group. |G| = |H|. |G| is called the order
- The order of an element is a, |a| is the smallest m s.t. $a^m=1$
- The order of |a| always divides evenly into |G|. So, $a^n=1$ where n is the order of G.
